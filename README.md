### **Problem Statement**

Direct mailings to a company's potential customers - "junk mail" to many - can be an extremely effective way of marketing a product or service, especially in the insurance field. However, as we all know, the vast majority of people who receive junk mail are uninterested in it. If a company sends out business mail too frequently, many customers may find it irritating. Sustainability is becoming an increasingly important part of not only people's lives but also industry standards. Sending mail to thousands, if not lakhs, of people is not exactly an eco-friendly way of life, as some of the recipients may find it wasteful and harmful to the environment.

Direct mail has fixed costs because it must be routed through the system. You must also design the mail piece, which may incur additional expenses. To determine whether direct mail is a viable option for you, calculate the ROI (return on investment).

Most of it is thrown away, wasting the company's money, filling landfill waste sites, or needing to be recycled.
In order to avoid some of this waste and expenditure, the organization would know more precisely whom to send it to if it had a decent understanding of its potential consumers.

Therefore, if we can solve the below-mentioned questions by using a predictive model, then we would be able to reduce to the capital burden on the marketing of an insurance company and increase the efficiency of the marketing strategies.
1. To identify the potential customers who would be interested in a caravan insurance policy.
2. Describe your current or potential customers and, if possible, explain why they purchased a caravan policy.

### **Binary Class Classification**

A classification task with two classes; e.g., classify whether a person purchases a caravan policy or not i.e,. 0 or 1.

Binary-class classification makes the assumption that each sample is assigned to one and only one label: a fruit can be either an apple or a pear but not both at the same time.

Common examples include image classification (is it a cat, dog, human, etc) or handwritten digit recognition (classifying an image of a handwritten number into a digit from 0 to 9).

In machine learning, binary classification is the problem of classifying instances into one of two classes.
